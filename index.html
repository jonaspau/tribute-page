          <p>Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, known as B-P, was born in Paddington, London on 22 February 1857. He was the eighth of ten children of Baden, a Professor at Oxford University, and Henrietta Powell. His father died when B-P was only three years old, leaving the family in a challenging situation.</p>
          <p>B-P was given his first lessons by his mother and later attended Rose Hill School, where he gained a scholarship to Charterhouse School. He was always eager to learn new skills and played the piano and the violin. While at Charterhouse he began to exploit his interest in the arts of scouting and woodcraft.</p>
          <p>In the woods around the school, B-P would hide from his masters as well as catch and cook rabbits, being careful not to let tell-tale smoke give his position away. The holidays were not wasted either. With his brothers he was always in search of adventure. One holiday they made a yachting expedition round the south coast of England. On another, they traced the Thames to its source by canoe. Through all this Baden-Powell was learning the arts and crafts, which were to prove so useful to him professionally.</p>
